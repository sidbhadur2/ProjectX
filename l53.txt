Hello,
it's me
I was wondering if after all these years
You'd like to meet,
to go over
Everything

They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be

When we were younger
and free

I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
There's such a difference
between us
And a million miles

Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
to tell you I'm sorry
for everything that I've done
...
