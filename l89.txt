hear them calling for you
I hear them calling for you

I feel the waves getting started
It's a rush inside I can't control
Your eyes keep pulling me in
I know, I know, I know

Your friends all talkin' 'bout me
They say I got no chance at all
Your fire is burning deep
In my soul, my soul, my soul

I ain't up for debating
Ain't in it for the taking
We got the world shaking

In the middle of the night when the wolves come out
They head straight for your heart
Like a bullet in the dark
One by one, I take them down
We can run and hide, ain't goin' down without a fight
I hear them calling for you
I hear them calling for you
...
