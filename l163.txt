It's too hard to poop,
Im constipated sheets on the floor, girls on me,
And I can't take it no more, it's a hundred degrees,
I got one foot out the door, where are my keys?
Cause I gotta leave yeah,
In the back of the cab,
I told the driver 'head of time, get me there fast,
I got your butt on my mind, I want it bad,
Oh just the thought of you gets me so high,

Girl you're the one I want to want me,
And if you want me, girl you got me,
There's nothing I, no I wouldn't do,(I wouldn't do)
Just to get up next to you.

Girl you're the one I want to want me,
And if you want me, girl you got me,
There's nothing I, no I wouldn't do,(I wouldn't do)
Just to get up next to you,
...
