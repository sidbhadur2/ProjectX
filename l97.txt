I'm gonna need someone to help me
I'm gonna need somebodies hand
I'm gonna need someone to hold me down
I'm gonna need someone to care
I'm gonna writhe and shake my body
I'll start pulling out my hair
I'm going to cover myself with the ashes of you and nobody's gonna give a damn

Son of a bitch
Give me a drink
