Said you want a little company
And I love it cause the thrill's cheap
Said you left him for good this time
Still if he knew I was here, he'd wanna kill me
But it's time you met the real me, filthy
But wasn't always, will be
Your pill refill and I'll still be
Your addiction, you can touch a prescription, but don't fill me
I let you see my dark side, but like a mic check, you got one too
So when the sparks fly, we hit the flight deck and got sprung, pew
Like an ejector seat, from an F-15
But tonight we don't need those pills, just the effects of each other
But we gon' film cause I will want your ex to see
(Get it?) that...

I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only fuck you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine

I only love it when you touch me, not feel me

When I'm fucked up, that's the real me

When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

And every time he hurt you, I heard you
