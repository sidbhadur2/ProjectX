I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl
And you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true

Guess she gave you things
I didn't give to you

Old friend why are you so shy
Ain't like you to hold back
Or hide from the light
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited but

I couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me it isn't over
Never mind I'll find someone like you
...
