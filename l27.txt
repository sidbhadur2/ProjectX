Sorry to disturb you
But I was in the neighborhood
About a friend, I've her picture
Could you take a look?

Oh, I appreciate you're busy
And time is not your own
Yeah, maybe it would be better
If I telephoned

Carrie doesn't live here anymore
(Carrie)
Carrie used to room on the second floor
(On the second)
Sorry that she left no forwarding address
That was known to me
