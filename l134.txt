Can we
We keep
Keep each other company? oh

Maybe we
Can be
Be Each other's company
Oh company

Let's set each other's lonely nights
Be each other's paradise
Need a picture for my frame

Someone to share my ring
Tell me what you wanna drink

I tell you what I got in mind
Oh I don't know your name
But I feel like that's gonna change

You ain't gotta be my lover
for you to call me baby
Never been around no presence
Ain't that serious
...
