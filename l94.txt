Something like a strong wind is coming over me
Has got a hold of me, yeah
Thinking and doing things I shouldn't be
Really I shouldn't be

Give it one more call
It's one more "whatcha doin right now?"
It's one more trip to my side of town
And you walk right in
It's one more here we go again

One more drink leads to another
You slide up close to me
Tear the t-shirts off each other
Your hands all over me
I tell myself I'm not in love
But one more time is not enough
One last kiss and then you're a goner
...
