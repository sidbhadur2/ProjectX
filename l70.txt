Gotta slow up, gotta shake this high
Gotta take a minute just to ease my mind
Cause if I don't walk then I get caught up
And I'll be falling all the way down.

(Hundred, hundred, hundred)
Hundred headlights making me blind
All of your pleasures catching my eye
If I jump once, then I never think twice,
But your temptations make me stay another night
And my senses only lie to me, lie to me
I don't know how I feel so wrapped in me, wrapped in me
I gotta check myself
Before I get what I want to
Find out is not what I thought it was
And you know why I

Gotta slow up, gotta shake this high
Gotta take a minute just to ease my mind
Cause if I don't walk then I get caught up
And I'll be falling all the way down.

Turning my head and shutting my eyes
Doesn't even matter if I'm wrong or right
Cause if I don't walk, I can't even sit around
And I'll be falling all the way down.
