Lickwood means rewind, a gunshot means forward
You requested it so we rewind

I got enemies, I got a lotta enemies
Got a lotta people tryna drain me of my energy
They tryna take the waaave from a nigga
Fuckin' with the kid and pray for your nigga

I got girls in real life tryna fuck up my day
Fuck goin' online that ain't part of my day
I got real shit poppin' with my family too
I got niggas that can never leave Canada too
I got 2 mortgages, thirty million in total
I got niggas that'll still try fuckin' me over
I got rap niggas that I gotta act like I like
But my actin' days are over, fuck them niggas for life, yea

I got enemies, I got a lotta enemies
Got a lotta people tryna drain me of my energy
They tryna take the waaave from a nigga
