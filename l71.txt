Alls my life I has to fight nigga
Alls my life I
Hard times like God
Bad trips like God
Nazareth, I'm fucked up
Homie you fucked up
But if God got us we then gon' be alright

Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me?
We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright

Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright

Do you hear me do you feel me?

We gon' be alright
Uh, and when I wake up
I recognize you're lookin' at me for the pay cut
But homicide be lookin' at you from the face down
What mac-11 even boom with the bass down
Schemin'!
And let me tell you bout my life
Painkillers only put me in the twilight
Where pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlight
I tell my mama I love her, but this what I like
Lord knows, 20 of 'em in my Chevy
Tell 'em all to come and get me, reapin' everything I sow
So my karma come and Heaven no preliminary hearing
So my record and my motherfucking gang can stand in silence for the record
Tell the world I know it's too late

Boys and girls, I think I gon' crazy
...
