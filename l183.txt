Lay your pretty head down on my shoulder
You don't have to worry anymore
This old world is cold and getting colder
And I know how to lock and load the door
I'm strong enough to hold you through the winter
Mean enough to stare your demons down
The hard times put the shine into the diamond
I won't let that keep us in the ground

I'm a riser
I'm a get off of the ground, old running hider
Push and comes to shove
Hey and I'm a fighter
Darkness comes to town, I'm a lighter
But get out aliver, out of the fire
...
