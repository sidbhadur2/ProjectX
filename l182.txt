I ain't rich, but I damn sure wanna be
Working like a dog all day, ain't working for me
I wish I had a rich uncle that'd kick the bucket
And that I was sitting on a pile like Warren Buffett
I know everybody says Money can't buy happiness

But it could buy me a boat,
it could buy me a truck to pull it
It could buy me a Yeti 110
iced down with some silver bullets
Yeah, and I know what they say,
Money can't buy everything
Well, maybe so,
But it could buy me a boat

They call me redneck, white trash and blue collar
But I could change all that
