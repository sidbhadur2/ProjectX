She packed my bags last night pre-flight
Zero hour nine a.m.
And I'm gonna be high...
As a kite by then
I miss the earth so much
I miss my wife
It's lonely out in space
On such a timeless flight

And I think it's gonna be a long long time
Till touch down brings me round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh, no no no
I'm a rocket man
Rocket man
Burning out his fuse up here alone
And I think it's gonna be a long long time
Till touch down brings me round again to find
...
