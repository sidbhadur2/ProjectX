When I need motivation

My one solution is my queen

'Cause she stays strong
Yeah, yeah
She is always in my corner
Right there when I want her
All these other girls are tempting
But I'm empty when you're gone
And they say
Do you need me?
Do you think I'm pretty?

Do I make you feel like cheating?
And I'm like no, not really 'cause
Oh, I think that I've found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
