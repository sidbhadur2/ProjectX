Bed, stay in bed,
The feeling of your skin locked in my head
Smoke smoke me broke
I don't care, I'm down for what you want
Day drunk into the night, wanna keep you here
'Cause you dry my tears
Yeah, summer loving and fights
How it is for us, and it's all because

Now if we're talking body
You've got a perfect one, so put it on me
Swear it won't take you long
If you love me right
We fuck for life, on and on and on
Now if we're talking body
You've got a perfect one, so put it on me
Swear it won't take you long
If you love me right
We fuck for life, on and on and on

Love can be love,
Anything you want I'll give it up
...
