You know I'm not one to break promises
I don't want to hurt you but I need to breathe
But at the end of it all, you're still my best friend
But there's something inside that I need to release

Which way is right, which way is wrong?
How do I say that I need to move on?
You know we're headed separate ways

And it feels like I am just to close to love you
There's nothing I can really say
I can't lie no more, I can't hide no more

Got to be true to myself
...
