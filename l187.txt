What if, what if we run away?
What if, what if we left today?
What if we said goodbye to safe and sound?
And what if, what if we're hard to find?
What if, what if we lost our minds?
What if we let them fall behind and they're never found?
And when the lights start flashing like a photobooth
And the stars exploding, we'll be fireproof
My youth, my youth is yours
Trippin' on skies, sippin' waterfalls
My youth, my youth is yours
Run away now and forevermore
My youth, my youth is yours
A truth so loud you can't ignore
...
