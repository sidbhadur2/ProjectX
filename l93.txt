I was born in a thunderstorm
I grew up overnight
I played alone
I'm playing on my own
I survived
Hey
I wanted everything I never had
Like the love that comes with life
I wore Ambien and I hated it
But I survived

I had wanted to go to a place where all the demons go
Where the wind don't change
And nothing in the ground can ever grow
No hope, just lies
And you're taught to cry in your pillow
But I'll survive

I'm still breathing
I'm still breathing
I'm still breathing
I'm still breathing
I'm alive
I'm alive
I'm alive
I'm alive
