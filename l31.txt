How can I just let you walk away?
Just let you leave without a trace
When I stand here taking every breath with you, ooh
You're the only one who really knew me at all

How can you just walk away from me?
When all I can do is watch you leave
'Cos we've shared the laughter and the pain and even shared the tears
You're the only one who really knew me at all
