I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Oh I'm not listenin', oh I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room with people who don't even care about my well being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So you can, go back, please enjoy your party
I'll be here, somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana with this boy who's hard
And I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here

Oh here, oh here
...
