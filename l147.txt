I know it's late, I know it's late
And baby I can't focus, focus
I just flew in until the day I'm hoping that you notice, did you notice?
I just posted my landing, oh
Wondering if the same old understanding, stands
I know you got work pretty early,
I'll be around 'bout 3: 30
Usually you done by one
So baby when I wake you up

Just let me rock
Sex you back to sleep girl
Don't say a word no, don't you talk
Just hold on tight to me girl

Sex you back to sleep girl, rock you back

Now where you at?
