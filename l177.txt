Do-do-do-do do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do do-do-do-do

Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me
Remember me for centuries
And just one mistake
Is all it will take
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries

Hey-ya, hey, hey-ya
Remember me for centuries

Mummified my teenage dreams
No, it's nothing wrong with me
The kids are all wrong
The story's all off
Heavy metal broke my heart

Come on, come on and let me in
Bruises on your thighs like my fingerprints
And this is supposed to match
The darkness that you felt
I never meant for you to fix yourself

Do-do-do-do do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do do-do-do-do
