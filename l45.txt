Me and my niggas tryna get it, ya bish
Hit this house lick tell me is you with it, ya bish
Home invasion was persuasive
From nine to five I know its vacant, ya bish
Dreams of living life like rappers do
Back when condom wrappers wasn't cool
I fucked Sherene then went to tell my bros
Then Usher Raymond "Let it Burn" came on
Hot sauce all in our Top Ramen, ya bish
Parked the car and then we start rhyming, ya bish
The only thing we had to free our mind
Then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs
You looking like an easy come up, ya bish
A silver spoon I know you come from, ya bish
And that's a lifestyle that we never knew
Go at a reverend for the revenue

It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison tell me what you do
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
And I been hustlin' all day, this a way, that a way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade and that's just how I feel
A dollar might, just fuck your main bitch that's just how I feel
A dollar might, say fuck them niggas that you came with that's just how I feel
A dollar might, just make that lane switch that's just how I feel

A dollar might, turn to a million and we all rich that's just how I feel

Dreams of living life like rappers do
Bump that new E-40 at the school
