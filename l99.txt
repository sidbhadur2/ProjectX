My life is a movie
and everyone's watching
so let's get to the good part
and pass all the nonsense

So I'm gonna start to do the right thing
When the pressure is coming down like lightning
It's like they want me to be perfect
but they don't even know that I'm hurting.

This life's not easy
I'm not made out of steel
Don't forget that I'm human
Don't forget that I'm real
Act like you know me
But you never will
But that's one thing that
I know for sure
