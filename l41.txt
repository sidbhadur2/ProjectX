killing the game feeling like i'm huntin' safari
you got that Jesus on your chain while you do nothing but party
i got my weed i got my drink but i'm focused
ghandi i feel the focus homie
so i'm taking over shortly
money on my mind but only because it's king
Obama dollar sign my president is green
run up in your residence rip apart everything
generation don't give a fuck about anything
never wanted to be an astronaut
i was just an outcast who would rap a lot
behind music, pussy was an afterthought
who'd a knew i'd be here or even half as hot
and so i wait while you sleep
train while you eat, bite the bullet you can see the stains on my teeth
treat the beat like the battlefield, call me Kubilai Khan
i'm on the sun, i don't know what planet you've been on
she's my moon i'm a star
i'll eb there .while i'm gone
...
