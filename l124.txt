Never really felt bad about it
As we drank deep from a lie
Cause I felt melting magnets babe
The second I saw you through half-shut eyes

Smoke and sunset, off Mulholland
He was talking, I was wondering 'bout
You and that girl, she your girlfriend?
Face from heaven, bet the world she don't know
Pretty girls don't know the things that I know
Walk my way, I'll share the things that you want
