Yeah

Halloween
Taliban, taliban
Jumpman, Jumpman, Jumpman, them boys up to something
They just spent like two or three weeks out the country
Them boys up to something they just not just bluffing
You don't have to call I hit my dance like Usher woo
I just found my tempo like I'm DJ mustard woo
I hit the Ginobili with my left hand up like woo
Lobster and celine for all my babies that I miss
Chicken fingers, french fries for them hoes that wanna diss
Jumpman, Jumpman, Jumpman, them boys up to something
Uh, uh, uh think I need some Robitussin
Way too many questions you must think I trust you
You searching for answers I do not know nothing (Woo!)
I see em tweaking they know something coming (Woo!)
Jumpman, Jumpman, Jumpman, them boys up to something (Woo!)
Jumpman, Jumpman, Jumpman, fuck was you expecting? (Woo!)

Chi-town chi-town Michael Jordan just said text me (Woo!)

Jumpman, Jumpman, Jumpman
