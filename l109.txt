All alone as you look through the door
Nothing left to see
If it hurts and you can't take no more
Lay it all on me

No you don't have to keep it on a locking key
Cause I will never let you down
And if you can't escape all your uncertainties
Baby I can show you how

Let my love in, let my love in
Lay your heart on me
If you're hurting, if you're hurting
Lay it all on me
You can lay it all on me
Lay it all on me
Lay it all on me
If you're hurting, if you're hurting
Lay it all on me

If you're scared when you're out on your own
Just remember me
...
