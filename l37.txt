Know I've done wrong, left your heart torn
Is that what devils do?
Took you so long, where only fools go
I shook the angel in you

Now I'm rising from the ground
Rising up to you
Filled with all the strength I've found
There's nothing I can't do

I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
