Do you want to be my love, my sight, my heart, and my eyes
My world, my pride, my stars in my skies
I'm looking for a queen who's more than gorgeous on a movie screen
I'm looking for the covergirl of dignified beauty magazine

I want dimples, and simple symbols that she's sweet
Wrinkles her nose, expose what I mean
I'm looking for a four-course meal that isn't based in base desire
I'm looking for a lady that knows the soul is more than an appetizer

Just one more thing
Just one more thing

Do we fit in the pocket, can we fix it back in the pocket
When the dreams and the drums start rocking
Can we dance with our knees not knocking
See I, I want a lady I can put stock in
I want a bass and backbeat to lock in
I want to know real love's not forgotten

I want a teacher who's eager to speak her mind
