I got a death wish, her looks can kill,
She's got a red dress, lipstick and heels

Pull me in, get me hooked like a junky
Got me feelin' so high

You're such a beautiful drug, I can't get enough
Addicted and I'm dyin' for a hit of your love
Got a death wish baby, baby
Don't want you to save me, save me

She lets her hair down, and all of mine stand up
Can't help but stare now, gotta feel that touch
Her kiss my vapor so sweet
Can't quit those lips are a habit to me
...
