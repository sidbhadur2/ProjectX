Oh, no
See you walking round like it's a funeral
Not so serious, girl; why those feet cold?
We just getting started; don't you tiptoe, tiptoe, ah

Waste time with a masterpiece, don't waste time with a masterpiece
You should be rolling with me, you should be rolling with me, ah
You're a real-life fantasy, you're a real-life fantasy
But you're moving so carefully; let's start living dangerously

Talk to me, baby
I'm going blind from this sweet sweet craving, whoa-oh
Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy
I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean
Walk for me, baby
I'll be Diddy, you be Naomi - whoa oh
Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy
I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean
