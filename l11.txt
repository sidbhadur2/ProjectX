I know you don't get chance to take a break this often
I know your life is speeding and it isn't stopping
You take my shirt and just go ahead and wipe up all the
Sweat, sweat, sweat

Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance

I know you don't get chance to take a break this often
I know your life is speeding and it isn't stopping
You take my shirt and just go ahead and wipe up all the
Sweat, sweat, sweat

Lose yourself to dance (Come on, come on, come on, come, on, come on, come on...)
Lose yourself to dance (Come on, come on, come on, come, on, come on, come on...)
Lose yourself to dance (Come on, come on, come on, come, on, come on, come on...)
Lose yourself to dance (Come on, come on, come on, come, on, come on, come on...)
Lose yourself to dance (Come on, come on, come on, come, on, come on, come on...)
Lose yourself to dance (Come on, come on, come on, come, on, come on, come on...)
