I stay up too late
Got nothing in my brain
That's what people say
Hmm, hmm
That's what people say
Hmm, hmm
I go on too many dates
But I can't make them stay
At least that's what people say
Hmm, hmm
That's what people say
Hmm, hmm

But I keep cruising
Can't stop, won't stop moving
It's like I got this music
In my mind, saying it's gonna be alright
Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate baby
I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake

I Shake It Off, I Shake It Off

Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake baby
I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I Shake It Off, I Shake It Off
I never miss a beat
I'm lightning on my feet
