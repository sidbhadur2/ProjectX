Hey
Don't think about it
Just move your body
Listen to the music
Sing, oh, ey, oh
Just move those left feet
Go ahead get crazy
Anyone can do it
Sing, oh, ey, oh
Show the world you've got that fire
Feel the rhythm getting louder
Show the world what you can Do
Prove to them you've got the moves
I don't know about you
But I feel better when I'm dancing, yeah, yeah
I'm better when I'm dancing, yeah, yeah
Oh we can do this together
I bet you feel better when you're dancing? Yeah, yeah
Lalalalala
Lalalalala
