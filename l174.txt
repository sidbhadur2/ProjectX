You make it look like it's magic
Cause I see nobody, nobody but you, you, you
I'm never confused
Hey, hey
I'm so used to being used

So I love when you call unexpected
Cause I hate when the moment's expected
So I'ma care for you, you, you
I'ma care for you, you, you, you, yeah

Cause girl you're perfect
You're always worth it
And you deserve it
The way you work it
Cause boy you earned it(shit)
Boy you earned it, yeah
