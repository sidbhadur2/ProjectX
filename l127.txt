If I could fly
I'd be coming right back home to you
I think I might
Give up everything just ask me to
Pay attention, I hope that you listen
Cause I've let my guard down
Right now I'm completly defenceless

For your eyes only
I'll show you my heart
For when you're lonely
And forget who you are
I'm missing half of me
When we're apart
Now you know me
For your eyes only
For your eyes only

I've got scars
Even though they can't always be seen
And pain gets hard
But now you're here and I don't feel a thing
...
