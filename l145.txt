Young Gerald, uh

This is the anthem
Told the world I need everything and some
Two girls that's a tandem
She gon' do all it for me when them bands come
Got it all, yeah I am young, rich, and handsome
Uh, This shit is not random
Everybody ain't got it, understand son

This shit is not random

It's my world and I do what I like to
I know she gon' be ready when I slide through
If you forgot I got it, then I'll remind you
Cause I got what they got
I am talking times two
Disagree with me and you've been lied to
I am nothing like you and no, I'm not the type to
Follow bullshit y'all give the hype to
I can see the fakes, so when I look in your direction
Understand I am seeing right through
You're hollow, you follow?
Everybody's not the real McCoy
