ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh
Oh, her eyes, her eyes
Make the stars look like they're not shining
Her hair, her hair
Falls perfectly without her trying
She's so beautiful

And I tell her every day
Yeah, I know, I know
When I compliment her she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so
Sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me, "Do I look okay?"

I say...
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
...
