From walking home and talking lows
Seeing chirps in evening clothes with you
From nervous touch and getting drunk
To staying up and waking up with you

Now we're slipping near the edge
Holding something we don't need
Oh, this delusion in our heads
Is gonna bring us to our knees

So come on, let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

Everything that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

And I'll be me

From throwing clothes across the floor
To teeth and clothes and slamming door on you
...
