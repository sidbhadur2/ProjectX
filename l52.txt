Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner
Sometimes I feel like my only friend
Is the city I live in
The city of angels
Lonely as I am
Together we cry

I drive on her streets 'cause
She's my companion
I walk through her hills 'cause
She knows who I am
She sees my good deeds and
She kisses me windy
Well I never worry, now that is a lie

And I don't ever want to feel
Like I did that day
Take me to the place I love
Take me all the way
