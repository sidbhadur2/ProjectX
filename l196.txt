I'm on probation i can't smoke too much!
Rollin through the streets almost sobered up
7 am and they know whatsup
We be on the rise they just waking up
No i don't supply i just smoke it up
You got the wrong guys you don't know bout us
This shit be too smooth for me to take it all
Are you gonna break or fall? Na i'd rather hit the stage with y'all

Bloaw, bloaw. Once i finish school i'll take you on a tour ow
Ow started trying less and started getting more!
And this ones for the nights spent on the floor
Anything to move around this world
It's that mista fel they all know me well
Them subs be low as hell
Everybody show love now
