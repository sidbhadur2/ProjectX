Your little brother never tells you but he loves you so
You said your mother only smiled on her TV show
You're only happy when your sorry head is filled with dope
I hope you make it to the day you're 28 years old

You're dripping like a saturated sunrise
You're spilling like an overflowing sink
You're ripped at every edge but you're a masterpiece
And now you're tearing through the pages and the ink

(Mmmm)
Everything is blue
His pills, his hands, his jeans

And now I'm covered in the colors
Pulled apart at the seams
And it's blue

And it's blue
Everything is grey
His hair, his smoke, his dreams
And now he's so devoid of color
