Yeaaah baby, 17
Ay, ay, look

Baby girl, you're so damn fine though
I'm tryna know if I could hit it from behind though
I'm sipping on you like some fine wine though
And when it's over, I press rewind though, ay
You talking bands, girl, I got it
Benjamins all in my pocket
I traded in my Trues for some Robins
He playing Batman, Fetty's gon rob him, ay
I got a Glock in my 'Rari, ay, 17 shots, no 38

I got a Glock in my 'Rari, 17 shots, no 38

I'm like, yeah, she's fine
Wonder when she'll be mine
She walk past, I press rewind
Just to see that ass one more time
And I got this sewed up
Remy Boyz, they know us
All fast money, no slow bucks

No one can control us
Ay, yeaaah baby

Tell me what you see
Is it money or it's me?
