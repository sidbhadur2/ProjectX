I went to the moped store, said "Fuck it"
Salesman's like "What up, what's your budget?"
And I'm like "Honestly, I don't know nothing about mopeds"
He said "I got the one for you, follow me"
Oh it's too real
Chromed out mirror, I don't need a windshield
Banana seat, a canopy on two wheels
Eight hundred cash, that's a hell of a deal

I'm headed downtown, cruising through the alley
Tip-toeing in the street like Dally
Pulled up, moped to the valley
Whitewalls on the wheels like mayonnaise
Dope, my crew is ill, and all we need is two good wheels
Got gas in the tank, cash in the bank
And a bad little mama with her ass in my face
I'm a lick that, stick that, break her off (Kit-Kat)
Snuck her in backstage, you don't need a wristband

Dope

Killing the game 'bout to catch a body
Passed the Harley, Dukie own a Ducati
Timbaland, Khaled, Scott Storch, Birdman
God damn man, everybody got Bugattis
But I'm a keep it hella 1987
Head into the dealership and drop a stack and cop a Kawasaki
I'm stunting on everybody, hella raw, pass the wasabi
I'm so low that my scrotum's almost dragging on the concrete
My seat is leather, alright, I'm lying, it's pleather
But girl, we could still ride together
You don't need an Uber, you don't need a cab
Fuck a bus pass, you got a moped man
She got 1988 Mariah Carey hair

Very rare, mom jeans on her derriere

Throwing up the West Side as we tear in the air
Stop by Pike Place, throwing fish to a player

Downtown, downtown (Downtown)
Downtown, downtown (Downtown)
She has her arms around your waist
