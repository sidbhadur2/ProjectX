I could lift you up
I could show you what you wanna see
and take you where you wannna be

You could be my luck
Even if the sky is falling down
I know that we'll be safe and sound
We safe and sound

I could fill your cup
You know my river won't evaporate
This world we still appreciate
You could be my luck
Even in a hurricane of frowns
I know that we'll be safe and sound
We safe and sound
We safe and sound
We safe and sound
