I been getting dirty money Jordan Belfort
Stacking penny stocks while I'm flipping these birds
Sipping on Ciroc, trip em up with the words
I just popped a molly and I think this be my third
Jordan Belfort
Jordan Belfort
I been getting dirty money Jordan Belfort
Stacking penny stocks while I'm flipping these birds

I just flipped a birdy, Money so dirty
Got my bitch a mink, furry like Furby
Came up made a milly, spent it on a rollie
Stackin gouda, feta, chedda cheese 'n' ravioli

Or maybe fettuccine, dirty martini
Imma fuck yo bitch, call me Houdini
