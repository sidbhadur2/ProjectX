Rusty barbed wire lines these fields
Cloud of dust behind the wheels
Drifting like my mind into the rearview
Jet trails cutting cross the sky
I'm rolling through the open wide
Searching for a song to drink beer to
And trying to find a place to disappear to

I light up the night and let it burn
Lean back and watch the sundown fade
Do what I do and life's a little sideways
I take a sip and say a prayer
Wait for the shoe and start and stare
Off at the headlights on the highway
That guy in the windshield looking back looks just like me
But there's a crack in the reflection
...
