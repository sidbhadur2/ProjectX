There must be something in the water
And there must be something about your daughter
She said our love ain't nothing but a monster
Our love ain't nothing but a monster
With 2 heads

I turn to you, you're all I see
Our love's a monster with 2 heads and one heartbeat
I turn to you, you're all I see
Our love's a monster with 2 heads and one heartbeat
We just got caught up in the moment
Why don't you call me in the morning instead
Before we turn into a monster
Before we turn into a monster with 2 heads
...
