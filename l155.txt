Nah nah, honey I'm good,
I could have another but I probably shouldn't,
I've got somebody at home.

It's been a long night here, and a long night there,
And these long, long legs are damn near everywhere,
Hold up now, you look good, I will not lie,
But if you ask where I'm staying tonight I gotta be like.

Oh baby, no baby, you got me all wrong baby,
My baby's already got all my love.

So nah nah, honey I'm good,
I could have another but I probably shouldn't,
I've got somebody at home, and if I stay I might not leave alone,
No, honey I'm good, I could have another but I probably shouldn't,
I've gotta bid you adieu and to another I will stay true.

(Hoo hoo wooh true), I will stay true,
(Hoo hoo wooh true), I will stay true,
(Hoo hoo wooh true),
(Hoo hoo wooh).
