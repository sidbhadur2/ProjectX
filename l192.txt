I'm feeling something, something different
When you left, the picture changed
I was blinded, I'm not envisioned
The same face in a different frame

It's an omen
Caught my baby crying
Saw the silver lining
It must be an omen
Needed you to show me
Without you I am lonely

My mind would rule my heart
I didn't pay attention to the light in the dark
It left me torn apart
But now I see your tears are an omen

Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-omen
Oh-oh-oh-oh
