You'll never make me stay
So take your weight off me
I know your every move

So won't you just let me be
I've been here times before
But I was too blind to see
That you seduce every men
This time you won't seduce me
She's saying that's ok
Hey baby do what you please
I have the stuff that you want

I am the thing that you need
She looked me deep in the eyes
She's touchin me so to start
She says there's no turnin back
She trapped me in her heart
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no

Dirty Diana
Let me be!
She likes the boys in the bands
She knows when they come to town
Every musicians fan
