Yeah! When I'm out in N.Y. boy it's blunts and Phillies
When I'm out in L.A. boy it's wraps and swishes
Now Blood walk to this, now Crips walk to this
Now throw it up, raise it up for that gangster shit
Now Blood walk to this, now Crips walk to this
Now throw it up, raise it up for that gangster shit

Im in my lambo maggot
my fo fo fagget
doors cliffed up im like go go gadget
see this shit I got on
homie i'd hate to
my teflon on boy my goverment issue
I hit your vertebrate, bullet went through tissue
your wife on the futon huggin her shit soon
homie you a bitch you got feminime ways
heard you got four lips and bleed for seven days
I got four fifths and bananas on the case
they got more whips than a runaway slave
