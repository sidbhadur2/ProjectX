N-n-now that don't kill me
Can only make me stronger.

I need you to hurry up now
'Cause I can't wait much longer.
I know I got to be right now
'Cause I can't get much wronger.
Man, I been waitin' all night now
That's how long I've been on ya.
Work it harder make it better
Do it faster makes us stronger

More than ever Hour after hour
Work is never over

I need you right now
Let's get lost tonight
You can be my black Kate Moss tonight.
Play secretary, I'm the boss tonight
And you don't give a fuck what they all say right?
Awesome, the Christian and Christian Dior
Damn, they don't make 'em like this anymore
I ask 'cause I'm not sure
Do anybody make real shit anymore?
Bow in the presence of greatness
'Cause right now thou hast forsaken us.
You should be honored by my lateness
That I would even show up to this fake shit
So go ahead, go nuts, go ape shit
Especially in my Pastelle, or my Bape shit
Act like you can't tell who made this

New gospel, homey, Take Six, and take this, haters.
N-n-now that don't kill me
Can only make me stronger.
I need you to hurry up now
'Cause I can't wait much longer.
I know I got to be right now
'Cause I can't get much wronger.
Man, I been waitin' all night now

That's how long I've been on ya.
Work it harder make it better do it faster makes us stronger
More than ever hour after hour work is never over
