We could have a little double wide planted in an empty field
We could have a big old white picket wrap around on a hill
Don't make a difference to me baby, where the wind takes me, long as I'm with you girl
We could have something or nothing, still be sitting on top of the world

Cause when you got love, like we got love
I'm holding on to heaven, holding on to you
When you got one, like I got one
Anyway you looking, it's a hell of a view

Don't know where we're gonna be
But I know we're gonna be
Sitting on top of the world
So keep hanging on to me
Yeah, don't you wanna be
Sitting on top of the world
Top of the world

We could be rolling on a couple of Goodyear's and painted rust
We could be strolling barefoot in the sand, in the setting sun
Yeah, any way you kiss me, flips me and gets me the right kind of tipsy, girl
