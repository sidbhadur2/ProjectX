You got the gas
I got the matches
We gonna turn this town to ashes
Cause they ain't never seen nothing like us
Ain't heard loud till we turn it up
I got the wild
You got the crazy
You know that's why I love you baby
Cause your motor runs just as fast as mine
Pedal to the metal, keep your throttle down all night
And we only get one life

Ain't scared to ride this train
Make a few marks, leave a few stains
Might slam just a little too hard
Might take it just a little too far
Might burn out like a firework,
Like a shooting star across the sky
...
