Baby, are you down, down, down, down, down?
Down, down
Even if the sky is falling down?
Down, down

You oughta know
Tonight is the night to let it go
Put on a show
I wanna see how you lose control

So leave it behind
'Cause we have a night to get away
So come on and fly with me
As we make our great escape

So baby, don't worry
You are my only
You won't be lonely
Even if the sky is falling down
You'll be my only
No need to worry

Baby, are you down, down, down, down, down?
Down, down
Baby, are you down, down, down, down, down?
Down, down
Even if the sky is falling down?
