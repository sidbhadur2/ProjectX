I know a place where we can go
To lay the troubles down eating your soul
I know a place where mercy flows
Take the stains make you whiter than snow
Like a tide, it is rising up deep inside a current that moves and makes it come alive
Living water that brings the dead to life, oh-oh-oh-oh
We're going down to the river
Down to the river, down to the river to pray
Let's get washed by the water
Washed by the water and rise up in amazing grace
Let's go down, down, down to the river (You will leave changed)
