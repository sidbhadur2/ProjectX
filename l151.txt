Through the wire, through the wire, through the wire
I'm watching her dance
Dress is catching the light
In her eyes there's no lies, no lies
There's no question, she's not in a disguise

There's no way out and a long way down
Everybody needs someone around
But I can't hold you, too close now
Through the wire, through the wire

What a feeling to be right here beside you now
Holding you in my arms
When the air ran out and we both started running wild
The sky fell down
But you've got stars in your eyes
And I've got something missing tonight
What a feeling to be a king beside you, somehow
...
