She took down the photograph
Of our wedding day
Ripped it down the middle
And threw my half away
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me
She broke all my fishing rods
Put my guns in hock
Threw my clothes out in the yard
And changed out all the locks
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me
