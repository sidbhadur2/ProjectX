Early morning take me over
Father, father, father
Take me to the top
o-oh, o-oh!
Early morning wake me up
Father, father, father

This is not enough
o-oh, o-oh, oh!
Hey, that sounds like my luck
I get the short end of it
Oh I love to be
I love to be the underdog, hey!
Hey, that sounds like my luck
I get the short end of it
Oh I love to be
I love to be the underdog, hey!

The underdog, hey!

The underdog, hey!
Early evening settle down
Father, father, father
Who am I to blame?
