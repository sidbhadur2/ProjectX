Oh well, I'm the type of guy who will never settle down
Where pretty girls are well, you know that I'm around
I kiss 'em and I love 'em 'cause to me they're all the same
I hug 'em and I squeeze 'em they don't even know my name

They call me the wanderer
Yeah, the wandere
I roam around, around, around

Oh well, there's Flo on my left and there's Mary on my right
And Janie is the girl with that I'll be with tonight
And when she asks me, which one I love the best?
I tear open my shirt I got Rosie on my chest

'Cause I'm the wanderer
Yeah, the wanderer
...
