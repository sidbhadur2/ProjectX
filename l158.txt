Uh... huh
Yeah!
Tell me am I going crazy? (Uh... huh)
Tell me have I lost my mind? (Yeah!)
Am I just afraid of lovin'? (Uh... huh)
Or am I not the lovin' kind? (Yeah!)

Kissin' in the moonlight,
Movies on a late night,
Gettin' old.
(Uh... huh)

I've been there, done that.
Supposed to be hot,
But it's just cold.
(Yeah!)

Somebody wake up my heart,
Light me up,
Set fire to my soul, yeah. (Uh... huh)
Cause' I can't do it anymore. (Yeah!)

Gimme that can't sleep love
(Gimme that can't sleep)
I want that can't sleep love
(Gimme that can't sleep)
