Peace up, A-Town down
Yeah! (yeahhh!) okay! (okayyy!)
Usher (Usher Usher Usher.)
Lil Jon!
Yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah) - yeah
Yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah) - yeah

Up in the club wit my homies, trying to get a lil V-I
Keep it down on the low key (low key)
You should know how it feels (hey! hey!)
I seen shorty she was checking up on me
From the game she was spitting in my ear
You would think that she knew me (knew me)
I decided to cheat (okay!) Conversation got heavy! (hey!)
She had me feeling like she's ready to blow! (watch out!)
Oh! (watch out!) She's saying "come get me!" (come get me)
So I got up and followed her to the floor
She said "baby let's go"
When I told her (let's go!) I said

(Yeah!) Yeah - yeah
Shorty got down on me, said come and get me
(Yeah!) Yeah - yeah
I got so caught up, I forgot she told me
(Yeah!) Yeah - yeah
Covering my girl, she be the best up on me
(Yeah!) Yeah - yeah
Next thing I knew, she was all up one me screaming

(Yeah!) yeah yeah (yeah!) yeah yeah - yeah!
(Yeah!) yeah yeah (yeah!) yeah yeah - yeah!

She's all up in my head now
