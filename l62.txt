Double OT
I'm a new breed
Saucin', saucin', I'm saucin' on you
I'm swaggin', I'm swaggin', I'm swaggin' oh ooh
I'm ballin', I'm ballin', Iverson on you
Watch out, watch out, watch out, yeah
I smash out, I smash out, I smash out, yeah
Spendin', I'm spendin' all my fuckin' pay
I got me some braids and I got me some hoes
Started rockin' the sleeve, I can't ball with no joes
You know how I do it, Concords on my toes
(This shit is hard)
I ain't rich yet, but you know I ain't broke, I
So if I see it, I like it, buy that from the store, I
I'm with some white girls and they lovin' the coca
Like they're OT
Double OT like I'm KD, smokin' OG
And you know me, in my 2-3s and my gold teeth
