When the heat is on, I fire back
In this cold world, where your lighters at
Let's burn it down, f-f-fire back

Could never say I was underground
Maybe a little misunderstood when I'm just riding round

In all lanes, like OJ
Doing big things, no small change
We ain't going nowhere like wine stains
You see me with the arsenal
Welcome to the arson show
Alumni, lace up, don't trip, I got it, bro
Sold out in my city, overseas in your state
Wore double X-L white T's as a freshman
