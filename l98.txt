I saw your picture in a paper, Honeymoon in Jamaica,
she's a lucky girl
You look so grown up in your black tux,
from a ball cap in a pick up, seems like another world
You and me and our big dreams, falling in love
We were two kids in the backseat, all fearless and young

I got the first kiss and she'll get the last
She's got the future, I got the past
I got the class ring, she got the diamond and wedding band
...
