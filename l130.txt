Keepin' it honest
You wouldn't want a young nigga if I wasn't whippin' this foreign
That's why I came back, top down

You gon have to do more than just (say it)
You gon have to do less when you (do it)
cause hot mama you know I (show it)
Always want you to (prove it)
You gon have to do more than just (say it)
You gon have to do less when you (do it)

Cause hot mama you know I (show it)

So you gon need to more than just (prove it)

And you know, you know

And you know, in this foreign car let it go

And you know, you know
And you know, in this foreign car let you know

I wanna know that I want you, and you want me
But I not know, you know I know
That this ain't right, cause you and me
Cause I got dough, ever since you walked in
Inside my foreign, slam my door
You know I know that you been on it

But I been on it, on the low
