Like a small boat on the ocean
Sending big waves into motion
Like how a single word
Can make a heart open
I might only have one match
But I can make an explosion

And all those things I didn't say
Wrecking balls inside my brain
I will scream them loud tonight
Can you hear my voice?

This time this is my fight song
Prove I'm alright song
Take back my life song
My powers turned on
Starting right now I'll be strong
I'll play my fight son
And I don't really care
If nobody else believes
Cause I've still got
A lot of fight left in me
...
