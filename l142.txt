What about the children?
Look at all the children we can change
What about a vision?
Be a visionary for a change
We're the generation
Who's gonna be the one to fight for it?
We're the inspiration
Do you believe enough to die for it?

Who's got the heart? Who's got it?
Whose heart is the biggest?
Wear it on your sleeve
That we can make a difference
Who's got the heart? Who's got it?
Whose heart is the biggest?
