You've gotta help me, I'm losing my mind,
Keep getting the feel you want to leave this all behind,
Thought we were going strong,
I thought we were holding on
Are we?

No they don't teach you this in school
Now my hearts breaking and I don't know what to do
Thought we were going strong
Thought we were holding on
Are we?

You and me got a whole lot of history
We could be the greatest team that the world has ever seen
You and me got a whole lot of history
So don't let it go, we can make some more, we can live forever
