Make a little conversation
So long, I've been waiting to let go of myself and feel alive
So many nights I thought it over
Told myself I kind of liked her
But there was something missing in her eyes

I was stumbling
Looking in the dark, with an empty heart
But you say, you feel the same
Could we ever be enough?
Baby, we could be enough

And it's alright
Calling out for somebody to hold tonight
When you're lost, I'll find a way and I'll be your light
...
