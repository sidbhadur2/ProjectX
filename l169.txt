Saw your body language and I know how you're feeling
You look like the kind of girl who's tired of speaking
Standing with somebody but he doesn't know what you like
You caught my attention, you were looking at me first
Saw that I can teach you, waking up in my t-shirt

If you're not into anything right now I can be your vice

All you need to know is
You can call me
When you're lonely
When you can't sleep
I'll be your temporary fix
You can call me
Even if it's just tonight
You can call me
When you feel like
Having a good time
I'll be your temporary fix
You can call me

I'm always what you like
Let me be your good night
