Yeah, yeah
(Hey, Buck Nasty, I like your beats!)
I finna, I finna, finna show you how to

Hit the Quan, hit the Quan, hit the Quan, hit the Quan
I said get down low and swing your arm
I said get down low and hit the Quan
I'm finna show you how to
Hit the Quan, hit the Quan, hit the Quan, hit the Quan
I said get down low and swing your arm
I said get down low and hit the Quan

I paper chase then vanish
Hit the Quan on her make her boyfriend panic
I heart Memphis, but I also love dancing
I done took off on em, I don't plan on landing
I call shots just do it like Nike
No FaceTime but the people want to Skype me
