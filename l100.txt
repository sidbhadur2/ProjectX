Turn your magic on, to me she'd say
Everything you want's a dream away
We are legends, every day
That's what she told him
Turn your magic on, to me she'd say

I feel my heart underneath my skin
I feel my heart beating
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again
Alive again
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again

Said I can't go on, not in this way
I'm a dream, I die by light of day
Gonna hold up half the sky and say
