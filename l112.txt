Take it slow but it's not typical
He already knows that my love is fire
His heart was a stone, and then his hands round
It turned him to gold and it's all good now
But I'll your day-dream, I'll be the favorite things
We could be beautiful, get drunk on the good life
I'll take you to Paradise
Say you'll never let me go!

Deep in my bones I can feel you
Take me back to a time when we knew how to be
We could wait the night with an old film
Smoke a little weed on my couch in the backroom
How did we?
