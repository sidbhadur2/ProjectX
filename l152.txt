It's a little bit funny
This feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
Don't have much money but boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live

If I was a sculptor
Ha
But then again no
Or a man who makes potions in a traveling show
I know it's not much but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song and this one's for you

And you can tell everybody
This is your song
...
