Oh
Oh
What you doing in this place?
Well, I could probably ask you the same thing
Another round, girl, what you think?
If you're buying, well, you know I'll drink
Some, make it 707
Do you want it on the rocks?
A double shot of heaven
Spilling out the top
And we'll go...

Shot, for shot, for shot
'Til we forgot what we came here to forget
Ain't a clock, a tick, a tock, that's gonna stop
A night that we won't regret
So put your drink down, throw your camera up
Flip it around and snap a payback picture
Send it to my ex
I'll send it to my ex
And send them both a text saying
"We ain't going home alone tonight"
Girl you ain't gotta, I ain't gotta go
