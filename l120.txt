Yeah, Mustard on the beat ho

Shawty hit me on the late night
Got a man, got me thinking, shawty, ain't right
She say she ain't about the creep life
But all she wanna do is take pipe
I ain't mad at nobody
I just wanna have your body
Now, I can give you the key, girl
Or you can meet me in the lobby
Talking bout it

Oh, I'll lay you down and go down
Girl, til I reach your ocean
Oh ooh
So come and get this d**k

When you need that fix, yeah, that medicine
I know you like it like this
When you get that itch, adrenaline
Heart beating outta your chest
Heart beating outta yo chest
And when that pressure's building
I got what you need, come f**k with me
And when you get that feeling
I got sexual healing
