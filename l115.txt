I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang

I was told when I get older all my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure and I care what people think.

My name's 'Blurryface' and I care what you think.
My name's 'Blurryface' and I care what you think.
Wish we could turn back time, to the good ol' days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out.

Wish we could turn back time, to the good ol' days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out.

We're stressed out.
Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's coming from
