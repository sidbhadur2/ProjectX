Give me fuel
Give me fire
Give me that which I desire
Ooh
Yeah
Yeah

Turn on, I see red
Adrenaline crash, crack my head
Nitro junkie, paint me dead
And I see red
A hundred plus through black and white

War horse

War head
Fuck 'em, man
White knuckle tight

Through black and white
Ooh

On I burn
Fuel is pumping engines
Burning hard
