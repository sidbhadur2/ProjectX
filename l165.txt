Don't take this the wrong way
You knew who I was every step that I ran to you
Only blue or black day
Electing strange perfections in any stranger I choose.

Would things be easier if there was a right way
Honey there is no right way.

And so I fall in love just a little ol' little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little ol' little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little ol' little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little ol' little bit every day with someone new.

There's an art to life's distractions
Somehow escapes the burning weight the art of scraping through
...
