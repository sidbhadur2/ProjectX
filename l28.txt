Tell me what you want
What you like
It's okay
I'mma little curious, too
Tell me if it's wrong
If it's right
I don't care
I can keep a secret, can you?

Got my mind on your body
And your body on my mind
Got a taste for the cherry
I just need to take a bite

Don't tell your mother
Kiss one another
Die for each other
We're cool for the summer

Take me down into your paradise
Don't be scared cause I'm your body type
Just something that we wanna try
Cause you and I
...
