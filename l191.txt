I remember when I first met you
Sippin coffee in a corner booth
you were twirlin your hair
and I just had to stare for a minute or two
i was laughin at your stack of books

then you shot me that smile
hey beautiful girl in your own little world let me in it
you got all of my attention and you ain't even tryin
yeah you're my kind of different

and I've never seen nothing
nothing like you
shades on spinning in the summer rain
dancin when there ain't no music

...
