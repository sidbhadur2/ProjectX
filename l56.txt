On the road he do it promo
You said keep our business on the low-low
I just wanna get you out the friendzone
Cause you look even better than the photo
I can't find your house, send me the info
Driving through the gated residential
Found out I was coming, sent your friends home
Keep on tryna hide it but your friends know

I only call you when it's half past, five
The only time that I'll be by, your, side
I only love you when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only fuck you when it's half-past, five
The only time that I can call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, baby

I'ma let you know and keep it simple
